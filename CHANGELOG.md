* **SystemParameters Warning**: Suppressed "No SystemParameters set" warning to debug level (only shows with `--debug`)
* **Finished Message**: Changed from "Finished Installation" to "Finished Modlist Installation" for clarity

## Version 0.3.5 - 2024-08-26
### Major UX Overhaul
* **Console Output System**: Complete redesign of progress reporting with single-line updates and timestamps
* **Progress Indicators**: Added duration timestamps to all operations for better user feedback
* **Download Progress**: Enhanced download speed display and progress reporting
* **Texture Processing**: Improved progress reporting during texture conversion operations

### Technical Improvements
* **Resource Concurrency**: Fixed VFS concurrency limits to restore proper performance
* **File Extraction**: Resolved race conditions and improved temp directory handling
* **Proton Integration**: Enhanced Proton window hiding and command execution
* **7zip Integration**: Optimized extraction parameters for Linux compatibility

## Version 0.3.4 - 2024-08-25
### Critical Bug Fixes
* **BSA Building**: Fixed race condition during BSA building by moving directory cleanup outside foreach loop
* **File Extraction**: Resolved file extraction race conditions with improved disposal patterns
* **7zip Extraction**: Reverted to single-threaded extraction to match upstream behavior and fix BSA issues
* **Proton Execution**: Fixed Proton command execution with proper path handling for spaces

### Performance Improvements
* **Texture Processing**: Optimized texconv execution via Proton with proper environment variables

## Project History

Jackify-Engine represents the **10th attempt** at creating a Linux-native Wabbajack fork. Previous attempts were destroyed by AI agents making unnecessary modifications to core systems that worked perfectly in upstream Wabbajack.

### Key Principles
* **Minimal Changes**: Only essential Linux compatibility modifications
* **Upstream Compatibility**: 1:1 identical output hashes to upstream Wabbajack
* **Performance Parity**: Target â‰¤39 minutes installation time (matching upstream via Wine)
* **Self-Contained**: No external dependencies required for published binary

### Critical Systems (Never Modified)
* Archive extraction logic (Wabbajack.FileExtractor)
* Resume functionality and temp directory handling
* VFS (Virtual File System) operations
* Core installation flow (StandardInstaller.Begin)
* 7zip integration and error handling

### Linux-Specific Features
* **Proton Integration**: Uses Steam Proton for texconv.exe execution
* **Linux Steam Detection**: Automatic detection of Linux Steam installations
* **Path Handling**: Linux-specific path conversion and case sensitivity handling
* **Build System**: Linux-optimized build script and distribution packaging

---

## Compatibility

* **Modlist Compatibility**: 100% compatible with upstream Wabbajack modlists
* **Output Verification**: Identical file hashes to Windows Wabbajack installations
* **Performance**: Matches or exceeds upstream Wabbajack performance
* **Platform Support**: Linux x64 (tested on Steam Deck, Nobara, Ubuntu)

## Requirements

* **System**: Linux x64 with .NET 8.0 runtime
* **Steam**: Steam installation with Proton (Experimental, 10.0, or 9.0)
* **Storage**: Sufficient space for modlist installation and temporary files
* **Network**: Internet connection for mod downloads

## Usage

```bash
# Install a modlist
./jackify-engine install -o /path/to/install -d /path/to/downloads -m ModlistName/ModlistName

# List available modlists
./jackify-engine list-modlists

# List detected games
./jackify-engine list-games

# Enable debug logging
./jackify-engine --debug install [args]
```

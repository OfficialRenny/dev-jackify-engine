## Project History

Jackify-Engine represents the **10th attempt** at creating a Linux-native Wabbajack fork. Previous attempts were destroyed by AI agents making unnecessary modifications to core systems that worked perfectly in upstream Wabbajack.

### Key Principles
* **Minimal Changes**: Only essential Linux compatibility modifications
* **Upstream Compatibility**: 1:1 identical output hashes to upstream Wabbajack
* **Performance Parity**: Target ≤39 minutes installation time (matching upstream via Wine)
* **Self-Contained**: No external dependencies required for published binary

### Critical Systems (Never Modified)
* Archive extraction logic (Wabbajack.FileExtractor)
* Resume functionality and temp directory handling
* VFS (Virtual File System) operations
* Core installation flow (StandardInstaller.Begin)
* 7zip integration and error handling

### Linux-Specific Features
* **Proton Integration**: Uses Steam Proton for texconv.exe execution
* **Linux Steam Detection**: Automatic detection of Linux Steam installations
* **Path Handling**: Linux-specific path conversion and case sensitivity handling
* **Build System**: Linux-optimized build script and distribution packaging

## Compatibility

* **Modlist Compatibility**: 100% compatible with upstream Wabbajack modlists
* **Output Verification**: Identical file hashes to Windows Wabbajack installations
* **Performance**: Matches or exceeds upstream Wabbajack performance
* **Platform Support**: Linux x64 (tested on Steam Deck, Nobara, Ubuntu)

## Requirements

* **System**: Linux x64 with .NET 8.0 runtime
* **Steam**: Steam installation with Proton (Experimental, 10.0, or 9.0)
* **Storage**: Sufficient space for modlist installation and temporary files
* **Network**: Internet connection for mod downloads
